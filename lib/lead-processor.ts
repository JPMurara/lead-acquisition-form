/**
 * Lead Processing Approach
 *
 * This file outlines the lead processing approach for handling
 * lead submissions and account management in the CRM integration.
 */

/**
 * Lead Processing Strategy:
 *
 * The lead processing workflow follows these steps:
 *
 * 1. **Data Validation & Transformation**
 *    - Validate all required fields are present
 *    - Transform form data to CRM-compatible format
 *    - Parse full name into first/last name components
 *    - Format phone numbers and email addresses
 *
 * 2. **Account Search, Creation and Duplicate Prevention**
 *    - Search for existing account by name and email
 *    - If found: Use existing account ID
 *    - Else: Create new account with customer details
 *    - Handle edge cases, e.g. multiple accounts. In this case consider phone number and email as additional matching criteria.
 *
 * 3. **Lead Creation**
 *    - Create lead record with all form data
 *    - Link lead to the appropriate account
 *    - Store chat history for context
 *
 * 4. **Response & Error Handling**
 *    - Return success/failure status
 *    - Provide meaningful error messages
 */

/**
 * Error Handling Approach:
 *
 * 1. **Validation Errors**:
 *    - Return specific field-level error messages
 *    - Suggest corrections where possible
 *    - Prevent invalid data from reaching CRM
 *
 * 2. **CRM Integration Errors**:
 *    - Log meaningful error information
 *    - Return user-friendly error messages
 *    - Implement retry logic
 */

/**
 * Future enhancements:
 *
 * **Bulk Processing**:Implement batch processing for high-volume scenarios
