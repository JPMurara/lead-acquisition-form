# Salesforce CRM API + conversational chat using OpenAI LLM Integration for Lead Acquisition Form

### Core Components

1. **SalesforceService** (`lib/salesforce.ts`)

   - Handles Salesforce connection and authentication
   - Implements SOQL queries for account search
   - Manages account and lead creation via REST API
   - Follows Interface Segregation Principle with separate interfaces for different concerns

2. **LeadProcessor** (`lib/lead-processor.ts`)

   - Orchestrates the lead processing workflow
   - Handles business logic for account/lead management
   - Provides data validation and error handling
   - Implements the Single Responsibility Principle

3. **API Endpoint** (`app/api/crm/route.ts`)
   - Generic CRM API for contact and lead management
   - Flexible request/response patterns
   - Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Data Flow

1. **Form Submission**: User completes the conversational form
2. **Validation**: Data is validated using Zod schemas
3. **Account Lookup**: System checks if account exists using SOQL query
4. **Account Creation**: If no account exists, creates new account
5. **Lead Creation**: Creates lead linked to the account
6. **Response**: Returns success/error response to client

## Salesforce Data Model

### Account Object

- **Name**: Full name of the customer
- **Email**: Customer email
- **Phone**: Customer phone number

### Lead Object

- **FirstName**: Customer first name
- **LastName**: Customer last name
- **Email**: Customer email
- **Phone**: Customer phone number
- **Company**: Customer name
- **Loan_Amount**: Requested loan amount
- **Loan_Type**: Type of loan requested
- **AccountId**: Link to associated account
- **Status**: Lead status (default: "New")

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Validation Errors**: Input validation using Zod schemas
2. **Salesforce Errors**: Connection, authentication, and API errors
3. **Business Logic Errors**: Account/lead creation failures
4. **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts and network issues

## Concepts for reusability and scalability

- `SalesforceService`: Handles only Salesforce operations
- `LeadProcessor`: Manages only lead processing logic
- `CRM API Route`: Handles only HTTP request/response
- Extensive error handling and data validation

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials stored in environment variables, such as OpenAI and Salesforce CRM API keys
2. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated using Zod schemas
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: SOQL queries use parameterized inputs
4. **Error Information**: Limited error details exposed to clients

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**: Add local database, so we can keep track of Accounts and Leads and save to 'local' BD before CRM interaction.
2. **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications for lead status changes
3. **Form Error**: Case form submission fails due to data types, the UI should present an form prefilled for the user who can edit any possible issues in the form input and retry to submit.
